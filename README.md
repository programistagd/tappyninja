A simple game similar to Fruit Ninja (but different) made in  libGDX in ~1 day.

I try to write clean code, however my main goal is to do make the game quickly so it's not of the highest quality but I think it could serve for a nice example of a simple game. I also try to keep it as simple as possible while being able to maintain the code with ease.
